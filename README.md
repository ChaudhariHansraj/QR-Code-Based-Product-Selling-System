# QR Code–Based Product Selling System

A smart and efficient billing system designed for shops, malls, and DMart-like environments, where products are identified and processed using QR codes. This project simplifies the shopping and billing experience for both customers and employees.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **QR Code Scanning**: Easily scan product QR codes for fast and accurate item recognition.
- 🧾 **Automated Billing**: Generates bills instantly after scanning selected products.
- 📦 **Stock Management**: Checks and alerts if requested quantity exceeds available stock.
- 👥 **Dual Operation Modes**:
  - **In-Store Shopping**: Customers pick products, and employees scan them at the counter.
  - **Counter-Based Orders**: Customers provide product details directly at the counter for billing or placing orders.
- 📊 **Database Integration**: Maintains real-time stock and billing data using MySQL.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Python (Tkinter or GUI, optional)
- **Backend**: Python
- **Database**: MySQL (via `mysql-connector-python`)
- **Tools**: XAMPP (for local MySQL hosting), QR Code generator/scanner libraries

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Employee scans QR codes on customer-selected products.
2. System fetches product details from the database.
3. Checks stock availability and updates inventory after billing.
4. Generates and prints a final bill for the customer.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python qrcode opencv-python
````

2. Import the provided `inventory.sql` file into your MySQL database (e.g., via XAMPP phpMyAdmin).

3. Update `db_manager.py` with your database credentials.

4. Run `qr_scanner.py` to start scanning and generate bills.

## 📌 Use Case Scenarios

* Supermarkets and malls with large inventories.
* Quick checkout system in retail stores.
* Dual-mode operation: Self-pick or order-at-counter shopping.
